# eRoboSim
Evolutionary Robotics Simulator - based on Enki engine

This app comes from the need of a multi-disciplinar and flexible tool for using 3D powered simulations in colective and evolutionary robotics.

For further instructions about the engine, Enki, please read the attached [README_enki](README_enki.md).

## Features

* Evolution Analysis with graph extraction and logging.
* Support for different tasks and robos which can be upgraded and modified at will.
* Several kind of controllers to drive the robots (mainly ANN's).
* LSP friendly implementation, with support for C++ and Linux (through BOOST).
* Customizable speed of simulation.
* Amazing and detailed manual (ToDo).


This project will have nice document improvements soon! Please, stay tunned :-)
